Getting Started
=======================================
This section will help you get started using Dynamics CRM Connect.

.. hint:: 

    If you do not have access to a compatible instance of Dynamics CRM,
    Microsoft offers a free 30-day trial for `Dynamics 365 <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/home>`_.

    (Microsoft regularly changes the URL for the trial sign-up, so you
    will need to use your preferred search engine to track it down.)

.. attention::

    It is assumed you have installed Dynamics CRM Connect on your 
    Sitecore server as described in the installation guide.
