CRM Contact Full Synchronization
=======================================

Dynamics CRM Connect comes with a pre-defined *pipeline batch* that 
reads both contacts and marketing list membership from Dynamics CRM, 
creates contacts in Sitecore that correspond to the contacts that 
were read from CRM, and associates the Sitecore contact with the 
CRM marketing lists that were read from CRM.
