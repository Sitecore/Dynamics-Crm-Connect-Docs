Confirm CRM Privileges
===========================

In order for Dynamics CRM Connect to be able to access account 
information from CRM, the CRM user used to connect to CRM must 
have the following permissions assigned:

* Read account entities

If these permissions are not assigned, an error will occur when 
Sitecore tries to read data from CRM.

Your CRM administrator can confirm that the CRM user has the required permissions.
