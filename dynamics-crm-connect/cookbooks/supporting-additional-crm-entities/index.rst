Supporting Additional CRM Entities
=======================================

Dynamics CRM Connect is built on a highly adaptable and extensible framework. 
It is possible to support virtually any entity from Dynamics CRM. 

In many cases this can be accomplished without any custom development. 
This documentation referrs to this type of support as "simple 
synchronization". Other cases require custom development. This  
is referred to as "complex synchronization".
