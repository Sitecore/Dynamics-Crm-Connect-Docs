Personalization
===================

Dynamics CRM Connect includes a condition for personalization
that allows you to determine whether or not a visitor is a
member of a CRM marketing list.

When configuring a personalization rule in Experience Editor, 
you can find this condition under the section **Dynamics CRM**.

.. hint:: 
    In order to configure this condition, you must first select your
    tenant. This is because the available marketing lists depends on
    the tenant you select.

.. attention::
    It is assumed you have synchronized CRM marketing lists. For 
    information on how to do this, see :doc:`/pipeline-batches/crm-marketinglist-sync/index`.
