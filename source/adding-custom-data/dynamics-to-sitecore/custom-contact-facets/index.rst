Custom Contact Facets
===================================================
In Sitecore Experience Platform, contact facets are used
to store data on contacts. This section guides you through
the process of creating a custom contact facet and 
configuring the synchronization process to populate 
the facet with data from Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Sales.

In this example you will create a custom contact facet 
to store the name of the account the contact is 
associated with.
